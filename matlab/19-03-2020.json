      "description": "LETO is a new hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian method for topology optimization. It transfers density information from movable Lagrangian carriers to a fixed set of Eulerian quadratures and solves force equilibrium with MPM. With carrier particles as design variables, LETO reparameterizes the Eulerian solution space in a Lagrangian view.",
